0.06    2013-05-08
        - URLs added to the list will no longer be made canonical. This is to

          want to make URLs canonical (or normalize them in any other way).
        - Host name retrieval is now eval'ed, so that illegal URLs added to the
          list won't break functionality.
        - Better logging when something fails.
        - Added Carp to prereqs.
